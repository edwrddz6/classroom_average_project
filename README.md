# Classroom Average Calculator

Classroom Average Calculator is a basic web application for managing student grades.

I used JavaScript to create, display, and update student data in an HTML table. Additionally, I implemented the calculation and display of the classroom's average grade. Throughout the project, I focused on JavaScript programming, DOM manipulation for interacting with HTML elements, modular development to organize the code, event handling, and importing/exporting modules for enhanced functionality.
